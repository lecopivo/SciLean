SciLean
=======


  Framework for scientific computing such as solving differential equations, optimization or machine learning written in [Lean](http://leanprover.github.io/). This library is in an *extremely early stage of development* and at its current stage is just a proof of concept on how Lean can be used for scientific computing.
